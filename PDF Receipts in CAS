PDF Receipts in CAS

Writing this commit to suggest development of a PDF receipt for each transaction that is executed on terminals.

Currently the terminals only allow for receipts to be printed, sms, or emailed shortly after the transaction. Especially for BATM2, clients
are calling in to request receipts that they did not receive. It would be helpful if the receipt was somehow available in CAS to be sent to 
the client by email or even sms.
