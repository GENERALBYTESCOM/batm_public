 * Event webhook - sent by Veriff to Webhook events URL.
 * The Webhook events URL needs to be configured in Veriff Station.
 * <p>
 * We can get two types of events:
 * - Verification events (this): tracks events for identity verification process performed by user.
 * - Proof of address events: if feature is enabled, tracks events for proof of address data gathering performed by user.
 * <p>
 * Verification events
 * To keep the clients up to date with progress during the verification process Veriff allows to subscribe to certain events.
 * Currently, two events are triggered:
 * - user arrives to Veriff environment and starts the verification process
 * - user is done with the process and submits the attempt.
